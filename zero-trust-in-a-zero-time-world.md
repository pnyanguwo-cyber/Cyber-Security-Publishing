# Zero Trust in a Zero Time World
*By Panashe Tilak Erwin Nyanguwo*

## Introduction

In a world where milliseconds matter and digital breaches move faster than policy updates, Zero Trust is no longer a luxury ‚Äî it's a necessity. As a Cybersecurity learner from Zimbabwe, I've come to understand that Zero Trust is not just a model, but a mindset shift that our continent ‚Äî and especially my country ‚Äî urgently needs to embrace.

## The Fall of the Old Fortress

For decades, cybersecurity was built like a castle: high walls (firewalls), a moat (network segmentation), and a single drawbridge (VPN access). If you were inside, you were trusted. If not, you stayed out.

> "In today's digital landscape, characterized by cloud-first operations, a multitude of diverse devices, and a geographically distributed user base, the traditional 'drawbridge' security model has become obsolete. Modern threats, including sophisticated phishing attacks, compromised user credentials, and the ability for adversaries to move laterally within networks, have rendered perimeter-based security largely irrelevant."

According to IBM‚Äôs 2023 *Cost of a Data Breach Report*, the average cost of a breach was **$4.45 million**, and **82%** involved data stored in the cloud. In Zimbabwe, where digital transformation is accelerating across banking, government, and education sectors, even small breaches could paralyze critical systems. Yet, many institutions still rely on outdated access models.

## What Zero Trust Actually Means

‚ÄúNever trust, always verify.‚Äù That‚Äôs the core of Zero Trust.

The Zero Trust model assumes that every request ‚Äî no matter where it comes from or who sends it ‚Äî could be malicious. Every device must authenticate. Every user must be verified. Every transaction must be logged and monitored.

There are three foundational pillars:

1. **Verify explicitly** ‚Äì Use multi-factor authentication (MFA), identity validation, and session monitoring.  
2. **Use least privilege access** ‚Äì Users only access what they need, nothing more.  
3. **Assume breach** ‚Äì Continuously monitor, log, and respond as though threats already exist inside your network.

This shift is more than technical ‚Äî it‚Äôs cultural. In many Zimbabwean organizations, especially public institutions, ‚Äútrust‚Äù is still based on roles, seniority, or proximity. But Zero Trust demands a shift to data- and identity-driven access decisions.

## Zero Trust in Practice

Globally, tech giants like Google and Microsoft have already embedded Zero Trust principles into their infrastructure. Google‚Äôs **BeyondCorp** initiative famously eliminated VPNs and moved toward secure, context-aware access for employees.

Closer to home, banks in Zimbabwe are beginning to deploy Zero Trust components ‚Äî like MFA, endpoint detection, and behavioral analytics ‚Äî to protect online transactions and customer data. However, adoption is uneven and mostly reactive.

In 2023, Econet Wireless reported increased cyber intrusion attempts against its mobile money platforms, prompting tighter access control. This is Zero Trust in action ‚Äî albeit under pressure.

## Barriers to Adoption in Africa

Zero Trust is powerful, but not plug-and-play. For Zimbabwe and other African nations, challenges include:

- Legacy systems that don‚Äôt support granular access control  
- Limited cybersecurity budgets  
- Skill gaps in Zero Trust architecture and implementation  
- Resistance to cultural change from implicit trust models  

But there's also opportunity. In many ways, Africa can leapfrog ‚Äî implementing cloud-native Zero Trust frameworks from the start, without legacy baggage. The rise of local cybersecurity training programs (e.g., ZICT, AfricaCERT, and university bootcamps) is a sign of readiness.

## Conclusion: Trust No One, Empower Everyone

In a zero time world ‚Äî where ransomware spreads in seconds and insider threats evolve hourly ‚Äî Zero Trust isn‚Äôt just a defensive posture. It‚Äôs a proactive framework for resilience.

As a learner committed to advancing Zimbabwe‚Äôs digital security maturity, I believe Zero Trust is our best hope to safeguard public trust, financial systems, and national infrastructure. It's time we stop building walls ‚Äî and start building verification.
